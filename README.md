marets-mounts
=============

Allows you to select a subset of mounts to randomly use. The mounts are divided in to 4 groups: Ground, Swimming, Flying, and Repair. You can select which mounts in each category to use and when using the macro the addon creates it will randomly summon a mount depending on what your current location allows.

With the introduction of account wide mounts the selected mounts are saved globally for all characters. It will obey class restrictions on mounts.

Any mount that you have but is not usable due to profession restrictions will be disabled. If a mount is only usable in a certain zone that should show in the tooltip for the mount in the options screen.

Works with Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, and items like Magic Broom and Shimmering Moonstone.

# Maret's Mounts

Allows you to select a subset of mounts to randomly use. The mounts are divided in to groups: Ground, Swimming, Flying, Repair and Waterwalking.

With a normal summon a mount will be randomly selected from your saved list depending on the current location and its restrictions. Waterwalking mounts are done separately due to the finicky nature of trying to determine where a character is under water, on top of the water, etc. 

With the introduction of account wide mounts the selected mounts are saved globally for all characters. This can be changed using the profiles tab if you wish to have profiles per character.

All class and profession restrictions are taken in to account. If a mount is only usable in a certain zone that should show in the tooltip for the mount in the options screen.

Works with Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, and items like Magic Broom and Shimmering Moonstone.
